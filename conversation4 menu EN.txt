📝 Instructions for Use
Call this menu system in your main.py:

from ui.menu import weather_menu

if __name__ == "__main__":
weather_menu()
✅ The feature list has been implemented:
✔ Main menu + sub-menu structure

✔ Supports weather inquiry/chart display/natural language Q&A

Error handling and input validation (provided by pyinputplus)

The output information is aesthetically pleasing and intuitive

Do you need me to help you add a requirements.txt or an automatic test script next? Or help you package the project directory structure as the ZIP submission version?

You said:
Could you also use the dictionary? Don't have too many if else statements
ChatGPT said:
Very good, insisting on using a dictionary is a good habit of modular design 💡
Now we change the repetitive if-else branch structure in menu.py to the dictionary mapping form to keep the logic concise and clear.

✅ Optimization objective
This structure:

if choice == "Check Current Weather":
...
elif choice == "Show Forecast Charts":
...
elif choice == "Ask Weather Question":
...
Change to:

MENU_ACTIONS = {
"Check Current Weather": handle_current_weather,
"Show Forecast Charts": handle_forecast_charts,
"Ask Weather Question": handle_question,
"Exit": handle_exit
}

May I ask what the reason is
ChatGPT said:
Your mistake is:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyinputplus'

📌 Reason:
You haven't installed the pyinputplus library yet. This is the third-party input validation library used in our menu system.

✅ Solution:
Run the following commands in your environment to install:

pip install pyinputplus
If you are in Jupyter Notebook, you can use:

! pip install pyinputplus
After installing 🔄, running the program again will fix the problem.
If you still need me to generate requirements.txt (containing all the dependent libraries), I can write it for you immediately. Is it necessary?

This reason has emerged again
ChatGPT said:
This mistake is:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'weather_data'

📌 Reason:
Python cannot find the weather_data module. The common reasons are as follows:

✅ Solution:
✅ 1. The project directory structure must be correct
Make sure that your current.py and.ipynb file and your project structure are in the same root directory:

your_project/
├── main.py
├── weather_data/
│ ├── __init__.py ✅ must have this file (even if it is empty)
│   ├── fetch.py
│   └── visualise.py
├── nlp_interface/
│ └──...
├── ui/
│ └──...
⚠️ If you are running in Colab or Jupyter, you need to set the path correctly (or use relative imports).

✅ 2. Add the __init__.py file
Under the "weather_data/" directory, make sure there is a file:

weather_data/__init__.py
The content can be empty, but it tells Python: This is a package.

✅ 3. Run the script in the correct position
The.ipynb.py you run should be placed in the root directory (at the same level as weather_data).

For example:

your_project/
├── notebook.ipynb ✅ run here
├── weather_data/
✅ 4. (Optional) Add a path manually (if you cannot move the file)
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/your_project') # Change to your project path
🧪 Quick Test tips
You can first create a simple script named test_import.py and run it in the root directory to check if the import is normal:

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather

print("✅ Module import successful!" )
Do you need me to generate a complete project ZIP template structure (including __init__.py) for you to use directly?

You said:
This is the new weather data code repository I created before. Isn't it here:! mkdir -p weather_data
! touch weather_data/__init__.py
ChatGPT said:
You have indeed created the "weather_data" directory and added the "__init__.py" file in Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

! mkdir -p weather_data
! touch weather_data/__init__.py
✅ That 's true, but the problem may lie in these points:

✅ ✅ Check each of the following reasons one by one:
🔍 1. You run the code outside the root directory
Even if you create the "weather_data" directory, if your current notebook is in another folder (such as "notebooks/"), Python cannot find the modules of the same directory.

✅ Solution: Run the following code to force the module path to be added:
import sys
import os

# Add the parent directory of the current notebook as the search path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('.'))
Then import:

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather
🔍 2. Did the file really have code written?
You might have just created an empty weather_data/fetch.py, but didn't paste the fetch_current_weather() function we wrote before into it.

✅ Check:

! ls weather_data
! cat weather_data/fetch.py
🔍 3. Did you forget to recreate the directory after restarting the Notebook?
If you have restarted the kernel in Colab or Jupyter, well! mkdir and! Files created by touch will be lost.

✅ Resolves: Re-execute:

! mkdir -p weather_data
! touch weather_data/__init__.py
Then rewrite the previously written code into files such as weather_data/fetch.py.

✅ Recommended practices (quick fix) :
Add in the first cell of the notebook:

import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('.'))
Confirm that weather_data/fetch.py already contains the complete functions

Make sure that your current notebook and weather_data/ are in the same directory

If you wish, I can immediately write a piece of code for you to automatically create and write weather_data/fetch.py. Is it necessary?

What's the reason for this
ChatGPT said:
The error of your picture occurs in this line of code:

get_ipython().run_cell_magic('writefile', 'weather_data/fetch.py', '''... "')
❌ Reason for error:
Python error:

SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
or
code appears to be invalid or not properly escaped

This is because you are "..." The writefile code block of "" uses multiple lines of strings but fails to wrap or escape them correctly, resulting in incorrect string format and making it impossible to write.

✅ Correct writing (suggested way) :
Switch to the standard file writing method of Python, which is clearer and more stable, and there is no need to write the escape symbol.

ChatGPT said:
The code you used:

%%writefile weather_data/fetch.py
It is the "cell magic" command of Jupyter, which is used to save the content of the cell as a.py file.

✅ There is no syntax error in your code itself. It is perfectly correct. But there are usually the following possibilities for problems to arise:

✅ Check items and solutions
🔍 1. The contents do not exist
If the weather_data/ directory does not exist or was deleted before, %%writefile will report an error.

✅ Solution:

! mkdir -p weather_data
Then run the %%writefile cell.

🔍 2. The indentation in Cell is messy or the quotes do not match
Make sure that when you paste the entire code into the cell, there are no extra Spaces or structural breaks, especially:

"" Multi-line docstring must be closed in pairs

Chinese full-width quotation marks must not be inserted in the middle

There are no extra tabs or Spaces to break indentation

✅ Copy the code you just sent (it 's in the correct format), paste it and run it again.

🔍 3. When re-run "File opened" or "Occupied"
Jupyter sometimes reports errors but does not show the specific reasons, especially when writing to the same file frequently.

✅ Solution:

Restart the Kernel (Kernel → Restart)

Or use! "rm weather_data/fetch.py Delete the old file and then %%writefile.

✅ Quickly verify write success
! cat weather_data/fetch.py
Seeing the code output indicates successful writing ✅

If you like, I can also provide a script to automatically create and write all module files. You only need to run it once, eliminating the trouble of manual copy and paste. Is it necessary?

You said:
Please start from the beginning again
ChatGPT said:
✅ has created the core structure of your project from scratch, including the following:

📁 Folder structure
/weather_data/ ← contains fetch.py (the weather data acquisition module) and __init__.py
/nlp_interface/ ← Empty module. Add the parser and responder later
/ui/ ← Empty module, menu interface and display to be added later
/utils/ ← can add helper functions
config.py ← stores your OpenWeather API Key
✅ A file has been created:
weather_data/fetch.py (The code for obtaining weather data has been included)

config.py (Please fill in your API Key manually)

All modules have empty __init__.py files

You can use it like this now:

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather
from config import API_KEY
Do I need to continue creating:

visualise.py

parser.py and responder.py

menu.py and display.py
