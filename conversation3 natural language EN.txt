Ok. Now let's move on to the second module: nlp_interface, which is responsible for understanding the user's natural language questions and returning the corresponding weather information.

🧪 Sample Call
You can call these two functions in main.py like this:

from nlp_interface.parser import infer_weather_intent
from nlp_interface.responder import generate_response
from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather

city = "Perth"
user_input = "Do I need a jacket tomorrow?"
intent = infer_weather_intent(user_input)
weather = fetch_current_weather(city)
response = generate_response(intent, weather)

print(response)
✅ This module is based on keyword matching and does not rely on machine learning. It is suitable for beginner projects.

Do I need to continue writing the menu interaction module ui/menu.py now? This will integrate your existing functions for users to choose and use.

You said:
I think there are too many if else statements here. Can a dictionary be used
ChatGPT said:
Very good idea ✅
Replacing if-else with dictionary mapping can make the code netier and easier to maintain, especially in parser.py, which is very suitable.
I'll optimize parser.py and responder.py respectively.

✅ optimised parser.py (using dictionary instead of if-else)

INTENT_KEYWORDS = {
"temperature": ["cold", "hot", "temperature", "jacket", "warm", "cool"],
"rain": ["rain", "umbrella", "wet", "drizzle"],
"wind": ["wind", "windy", "breeze", "gust"]

def infer_weather_intent(user_input):

Return intent based on keyword match: "temperature", "rain", "wind", or None.
"" "
user_input = user_input.lower()
for intent, keywords in INTENT_KEYWORDS.items():
if any(keyword in user_input for keyword in keywords):
return intent
return None
✅ Optimization idea description:
All intentions and keywords are concentrated in the INTENT_KEYWORDS dictionary for convenient maintenance.

If you want to add "UV index", "air quality", etc. later, just expand the dictionary.

🤔 responder.py can dictionary also be used?
Some parts are acceptable, but since it involves conditional judgments (such as temperature range, wind speed intensity, etc.), the if judgment logic block still needs to be used. However, you can optimize it like this:

Create a dictionary of template sentences

Split the logical part into separate functions (to improve structural clarity)

if you wish, I can help you further optimize the structure of responder.py to make it use as few ifs as possible and replace them with function mappings.

Do I need to continue optimizing responder.py?

You said:
I think the first part of this module is okay. Should we add more word fault-tolerant functions
ChatGPT said:
Great addition! You can enhance the fault tolerance of users' input keywords through fuzzy matching. For example, even if "temprature" is misspelled, it can still be recognized as "temperature".

We can implement this function using the difflib standard library of Python (no additional installation required). The following is the improved parser.py:

✅ parser.py with spell tolerance (using difflib.get_close_matches)

from difflib import get_close_matches

INTENT_KEYWORDS = {
"temperature": ["cold", "hot", "temperature", "jacket", "warm", "cool"],
"rain": ["rain", "umbrella", "wet", "drizzle"],
"wind": ["wind", "windy", "breeze", "gust"]
}

# Flatten all keywords to map them to intents
KEYWORD_TO_INTENT = {
keyword: intent
for intent, keywords in INTENT_KEYWORDS.items()
for keyword in keywords
}

def infer_weather_intent(user_input):
"" "
Infer weather intent from input using exact and fuzzy keyword matching.
Returns one of: "temperature", "rain", "wind", or None.
"" "
user_input = user_input.lower().split()

for word in user_input:
# Exact match
if word in KEYWORD_TO_INTENT:
return KEYWORD_TO_INTENT[word]
# Fuzzy match (e.g., 'temprature' -> 'temperature')
match = get_close_matches(word, KEYWORD_TO_INTENT.keys(), n=1, cutoff=0.8)
if match:
return KEYWORD_TO_INTENT[match[0]]

return None
🧪 can recognize these misspellings:
Incorrect spelling is correctly identified as
temprature	temperature
windey	wind
umbrela	rain
✅ Advantages:
The user experience is better and the fault tolerance is stronger

Keywords can be flexibly expanded

No additional installation of any third-party libraries is required (difflib is the standard library).

Do I need to optimize the structure of responder.py as well? Or now move on to the next module (ui/menu.py)?

You said:
Please also optimize the responder
ChatGPT said:
Very good. Let's optimize responder.py. This module originally used more if-else judgments. The following are the optimization goals:

✅ Optimization objective
Try to organize the intent and response functions through dictionary mapping

The logic of each type of weather information is separately encapsulated as a function (such as processing temperature, wind speed, etc.)

Retain the necessary range judgment logic (for example, if should still be used for determining the temperature level)

if handler:
return handler(weather_data)
else:
return "I'm not sure what weather info you need. Please ask about temperature, rain, or wind."
✅ Optimization Advantage
Description of advantages
Modular logic separates each intent from a separate processing function
The clear structure intent function mapping table (INTENT_HANDLERS) is at a glance
It is more convenient to expand and add UV and air quality. Just write a function and add a dictionary key-value pair
If you wish, I can continue to develop the ui/menu.py menu system module for you next, integrating all functions (weather query, charts, natural language questions). Shall we continue?
