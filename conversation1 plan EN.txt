I need to complete a python project for weather forecasting. Its core component is the weather data component (retrieving weather data at the location specified by the user, displaying the current situation and prediction, including three different data visualizations: temperature trend, precipitation probability, and wind speed). In the natural language interface, it allows users to ask weather-related questions in simple English. Analyze these issues to determine the required weather information and provide natural language responses to answer users' questions. In terms of user experience, pyinputplus is used to implement an intuitive menu system, including clear instructions and error handling, providing clear and orderly information display. In terms of technical requirements, I hope to decompose the program into logical functions and modules

And use appropriate naming conventions to include document strings and comments. Please give me a preliminary project plan

This is the initial plan of your weather forecast project, covering architecture design, module division, functional overview and technical specifications:

🔧 2. Description of the main functional modules
Weather Data Module
fetch.py

Obtain using the OpenWeather API:

Current weather

Forecast for the next 5 days (with a 3-hour interval)

Supports query by city name. Later, longitude and latitude/region code can be expanded

visualise.py

plot_temperature_trend(): The line graph shows the future temperature

plot_precipitation_probability(): The bar chart shows the probability of precipitation

plot_wind_speed(): A line graph or radar chart shows the variation of wind speed

2. Natural Language Interaction Module (nlp_interface)
parser.py

Use simple rules/keywords to identify the intention of the question (such as temperature, rain, strong wind, etc.)

Handle ambiguous expressions (such as "Do you need to wear a coat?" → temperature/wind speed judgment)

responder.py

Generate friendly responses based on the parser output, such as:

“Yes, you might want a jacket tomorrow in Melbourne. The temperature will be around 14°C.”

3. User Interface Module (ui)
menu.py

Implement the interactive main menu using pyinputplus

It includes options such as: checking the current weather, viewing visual charts, asking weather questions, and exiting

display.py

Clearly display the query results and error prompts

Support warm reminders and unit annotations

📌 III. Technical and specification requirements
All functions use the PEP8 naming convention

All modules and functions contain clear docStrings

Add appropriate annotations for each step

Manage dependency packages (such as requests, matplotlib, pyinputplus) using requirements.txt
