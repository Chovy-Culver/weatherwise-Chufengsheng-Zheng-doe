🛠️ You will also need:
Create config.py

API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key"
Installation dependencies:

pip install requests matplotlib
Do I need to help you generate the next module (such as the natural language parsing nlp_interface) next?

You said:
May I ask what my order should be
ChatGPT said:
The recommended development sequence of your project is as follows. Each step is based on the previous one to ensure the smooth integration and testing of the modules:

✅ Step 1: Environment preparation and configuration
Install the required libraries: requests, matplotlib, pyinputplus

New project structure and directory

Add config.py and fill in your API Key

Test whether the weather data can be successfully obtained from the API (using fetch_current_weather)

✅ Step 2: Weather data module development
Complete and test:

fetch_current_weather() and fetch_forecast_weather() can return valid data

Three visualization functions can draw charts (temperature, precipitation, wind speed)

Ensure that fetch and visualise are separate, reusable and well modularized

🔄 Step 3: Natural Language Processing module development (nlp_interface)
Create parser.py:

Analyze users' problems, such as "Do I need an umbrella tomorrow?"

Extract keywords → Convert them into query instructions (location + weather type)

Create responder.py:

Generate English responses based on the intentions extracted by the parser and the API data

Simulate natural language (without GPT, using conditional judgments and template statements)

🔘 Step 4: User Interface module development (ui)
Create menu.py and implement it using pyinputplus:

Main Menu (Selection Function)

Submenu (Enter city, date, question)

Create display.py to display the query results

Format and output the weather data

Output error prompts or user descriptions

🔁 Step 5: main program integration (main.py)
The main course features weather inquiry, chart display and natural language dialogue functions

Control program flow

Add exception handling and clear prompts

🎯 Step 6: Test and optimize
Check whether each module can run independently

Verify whether the overall integration is stable

Add comments and docstring

Optional: Add log recording, error tracking, etc

Would you like me to list a corresponding file development sequence list + completion status checklist for you?

You said:
Uploaded pictures
May I ask if the output content is in this form of code and if the code runs correctly
ChatGPT said:
Yes, this kind of output indicates that the code is running normally and the environment is ready. The explanation is as follows:

✅ Output explanation:
You ran one of the following commands:

pip install requests matplotlib
And the system returns:

Requirement already satisfied: ...
This indicates:

Dependencies such as requests and matplotlib have been successfully installed.

All dependent libraries are already exists in your current Python environment (such as/usr/local/lib/python3.11 /...).

✅ The next step can go on:
You can now rest assured to start developing the weather data module, including:

Write fetch.py to fetch weather data

Write visualise.py to implement the chart display function

If you have already written fetch_current_weather(city), you can try the following code to test whether it returns data normally:

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather

data = fetch_current_weather("Perth")
print(data)
If the output is a dictionary (including weather descriptions, temperatures, etc.), it indicates that your API call is also normal.

Do you need me to write a simple test script for you to check whether fetch.py works?

You said:
Ok.
ChatGPT said:
The following is a simple test script, test_fetch.py, used to verify whether the functions in the fetch.py module can correctly obtain the weather data:

✅ test_fetch.py
"" "
test_fetch.py - Simple test script for fetch_current_weather and fetch_forecast_weather.
"" "

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather, fetch_forecast_weather

def test_fetch_weather():
city = "Perth"

print("🔍 is testing current weather data..." )
current = fetch_current_weather(city)
if current:
print("✅ Current weather gets successful!" )
print(f" City: {current['name']}")
Print (f "weather: {current [' weather '] [0] [' description ']}")
print(f" Temperature: {current['main']['temp']}°C")
else:
print("❌ Current weather failed ")

print(" 🔍 is testing the weather forecast data..." )
forecast = fetch_forecast_weather(city)
if forecast:
print("✅ Weather forecast got successful!" )
print(f" There are a total of {len(forecast['list'])} data items ")
print(f" First time: {forecast['list'][0]['dt_txt']}")
Print (f "predicted temperature: {forecast [' list '] [0] [' main '] [' temp ']} ° C")
else:
print("❌ Failed to get the weather forecast ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
test_fetch_weather()
📝 Instructions for Use:
Save this code as test_fetch.py

Make sure that the API Key has been correctly filled in config.py:

API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key"
Perform the test:

python test_fetch.py
If you see "✅ Current Weather gets successful!" And "✅ Get the weather forecast successful!" It indicates that the fetch.py module is completely normal. Next, we can proceed to develop the visualization module or the natural language module.

Would you like me to set up nlp_interface/parser.py for you now?

You said:
Can this piece of code be completely converted into English
ChatGPT said:
Sure. The following is the full English version of test_fetch.py. All the comments and output prompts have been translated:

✅ test_fetch.py (English Version)
"" "
test_fetch.py - Simple test script for fetch_current_weather and fetch_forecast_weather.
"" "

from weather_data.fetch import fetch_current_weather, fetch_forecast_weather

def test_fetch_weather():
city = "Perth"

print("🔍 Testing current weather data..." )
current = fetch_current_weather(city)
if current:
print("✅ Current weather fetched successfully!" )
print(f"City: {current['name']}")
print(f"Condition: {current['weather'][0]['description']}")
print(f"Temperature: {current['main']['temp']}°C")
else:
print("❌ Failed to fetch current weather.")

print("\n🔍 Testing forecast weather data..." )
forecast = fetch_forecast_weather(city)
if forecast:
print("✅ Forecast data fetched successfully!" )
print(f"Total data points: {len(forecast['list'])}")
print(f"First timestamp: {forecast['list'][0]['dt_txt']}")
print(f"Predicted temperature: {forecast['list'][0]['main']['temp']}°C")
else:
print("❌ Failed to fetch forecast weather.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
test_fetch_weather()
✅ If you run it and see ✅ Current weather fetched successfully! And ✅ Forecast data fetched successfully! It indicates that your fetch.py module is working properly.

Should we proceed to the next module: nlp_interface/parser.py? I can help you write the basic intent analysis code in the English annotated version.

You said:
There is no need to test for now
ChatGPT said:
Ok, I see ✅
We have completed:

✅ Project proposal confirmation

✅ Install dependencies & Check successful

✅ The weather_data module (fetch.py, visualise.py) is ready

✅ Optional test scripts are available

Next, if you need to continue developing the next module (such as the natural language processing nlp_interface, menu interaction ui/menu.py, or the main program main.py), please let me know at any time. I will continue to generate clear-structured, English annotated, and modular code for you.

Do you need me to help you plan the next stage of work or start code development immediately?
You said:
May I ask if the three visualizations: temperature trend, precipitation probability and wind speed are also included
ChatGPT said:
Yes, those three visualization functions are already included in your existing weather_data/visualise.py module and are implemented respectively through the following functions:

✅ Overview of visual features
Visualization type function name Chart type data source field
🌡 ️ temperature trend plot_temperature_trend () line chart entry [' main '] [' temp ']
🌧️ Probability of precipitation (POP) plot_precipitation_probability() Bar chart entry.get('pop', 0)
Trend plot_wind_speed 🌬 ️ wind speed () line chart or dotted line chart entry [' wind '] [' speed ']
File where 📁
All these three functions are concentrated in:

weather_data/visualise.py
You only need to call these functions and pass in forecast_data and city to display the chart, for example:

from weather_data.visualise import plot_temperature_trend
plot_temperature_trend(forecast_data, "Perth")
If you want these charts to be generated directly through menu options, I can help you write an interactive interface (such as ui/menu.py) to select the charts to be displayed.

Do I need to continue building the menu system for you? (Including: current weather, three types of charts, natural language dialogue)
