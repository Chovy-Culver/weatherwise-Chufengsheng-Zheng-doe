# WeatherWise

**WeatherWise** is a modular Python application that provides weather insights through both interactive menus and natural language questions. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, displays current conditions and forecast trends, and supports intelligent dialogue to help users decide on weather-related actions—like whether to carry an umbrella or wear a coat.
